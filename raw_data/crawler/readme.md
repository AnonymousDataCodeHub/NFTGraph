This folder contains the code for crawlering transaction details from the Etherscan website.

The crawler is designed to search for and download the transaction list based on the token address and transaction hash. All token addresses are listed in the `token_category.csv` file. All transaction hashes for the tokens are listed in the `txhash—Noduplicates.csv` file. The hashes are obtained by the Etherscan's API.


`txhash—Noduplicates.csv` can be downloaded via https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L48Kj6UsRoZnKWDLMCBEDpd2wZu4wtFX/view?usp=share_link .
