We design a static link prediction task and select five advanced GNN models, 
namely SEAL, SEAL+NGNN, SUREL, SIEG, and AGDN, as well as three basic GNN models: GraphSAGE, GAT, and GCN. 
We use two metrics, namely Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and AUC, to evaluate their performance. 
MRR is the mean of reciprocal ranks measuring the reciprocal ranks over a set of listed results, 
and AUC is the area under the ROC curve.
